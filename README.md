## Dataset Content
* - Health Care Insurance dataset contains information on personal attributes and is complied into 7 categories(age, gender, BMI, family size, smoker or non-smoker, region and charges). This data set has 7 columns and 1338 rows.  

## Business Requirements
 * - Analyse healthcare insurance data to understand how personal attributes and geographic factors influence insurance costs and develop predictive models for estimating healthcare expenses. Provide insights and predictive reports for estimating healthcare insurance charges based on personal and geographic attributes.
 * - Make a correlations on these factors and see how it affects health insurance charges. 

## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 


* Hypothesis 1.

* - Does Gender play a major role in how charges are applied?

* - Answer: Too many factors to conclude that gender plays a role in increased health insurance charges, in the scatterplot males was the highest but only marginally.

* Hypothesis 2.

* - Does Children play role in health insurance cost?

* - Answer: Yes, individuals with 0 children were charged the most and 5 plus was charged the less.

* Hypothesis 3.

* - Checking the other categories against health insurance charges.

* - Answer: Non-smokers stands out, has a lot of Outliers in relation to increased health insurance.

* Hypothesis 4.

* - Find the correlation with the non-smoker outliers as to why the increased in health insurance.

* - Answer: Age plays the most significant factor in determining health insurance cost, 18-20 was the highest for both male and female and so was 60 plus. Side note region was in the south area was where both highest cost were charged.


## Project Plan
* Outline the high-level steps taken for the analysis.
* 1. Data Retrieval and Loading from Kaggle to my VS code IDE
* 2. Verified data quality, types and missing values before running data visualisation.       

* How was the data managed throughout the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation steps?
* - Data was managed using the following data visualisation tool:- Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly.
* - Various plots were used as the DataFrame has various different data types this helped interpret the data more effectively.

* Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?


## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations
* - The goal was to see what personal attributes and geographic factors influenced health insurance costs.

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
* Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
* How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?

* - To answer both questions the DataSet was from a public server called Kaggle an open source DataSet collection website, no personal data is used in these DataSets. 


## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 




## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.

* - Pandas: Convert CSV file to a DataFrame
* - Numpy: Numerical values
* - Matplotlib: Various Data Plots
* - Seaborn:  Various Data Plots
* - Plotly: Interactive Data Plots


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
